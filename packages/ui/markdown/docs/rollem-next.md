# Rollem Next

If you want the latest updates, you can invite Rollem Next to your server.

[**Invite Rollem-Next**](/invite/next/ "color:primary")

## Configuring
Until the website is ready, configuration is done by granting roles to Rollem or to specific users.

Rollem roles (guild-wide):
- `rollem:beta` - use the unstable preview syntax for v1
- `rollem:v2` - use the in-development v2 syntax

User roles (overrides the above):
- `rollem:v1` - use the stable v1 syntax
- `rollem:beta` - use the unstable preview syntax for v1
- `rollem:v2` - use the in-development v2 syntax

Rollem Next will reply just as Rollem does. As such, you should not have Rollem and Rollem Next active in the same channe.
