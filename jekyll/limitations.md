In order to keep things fast and avoid spamming the chat, there are some limits on what Rollem will do.

## Limitations
* Rollem will not roll more than 100 dice.
* Rollem will not roll "one-sided" dice.
* Rollem will not roll single numbers.
* Pure math must be prefixed with `&` or `r`.
* Rolls prefixed with `N#` will be rolled `N` times. N > 100 will be ignored.
* Exploding Dice ranges that are too large will be ignored. (99.99% chance of exploding)
